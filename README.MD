> # ML Crash Course

- This handson uses the sklearn's load Diabetes dataset
- This dataset already mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the square root of "n_samples" (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).
- Following regression algorithm is used:
    - SVR
    - LinearRegression
    - DecissionTreeRegressor
    - RandomForestRegressor


# How to run
- open the terminal where you clone the repository | `git clone https://github.com/Navazdeen/ML_handson.git`
- Create an env | `python -m venv Ml-venv`
- install the requirements from requirements.txt file | `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Select the kernel as Ml-venv
- Run the cells | Ctrl - Enter
